# GAN

## Overview
This project is based on these research papers.
- [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
- [Improved Techniques for Training GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498)
- [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
- [DCGAN TUTORIAL](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html)

## Technical Aspect

In this project we created two separate python file, in the first one, we define two different classes as Discriminator & Generator. We used [MNIST dataset](https://opendatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PyTorch-632x300.png).
